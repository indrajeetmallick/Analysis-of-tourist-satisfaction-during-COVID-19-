# Analysis-of-tourist-satisfaction-during-COVID-19-
<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to disentangle the impact of pandemic precaution trust and prevention measures on tourist satisfaction, with a specific focus on the unique challenges faced by small businesses. To achieve this, we conducted interviews (Ad-hoc surveys) with tourists in a north Mediterranean coastal destination of Spain during the challenging summer of 2020, marked by the pandemic's worst effects. To execute this research, a two-tiered methodology was employed, combining Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) with partial least squares-path modeling (PLS-PM).
