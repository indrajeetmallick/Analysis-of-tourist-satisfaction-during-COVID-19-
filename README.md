# Navigating Tourists' Demand amidst COVID-19: Unravelling the Effects of Reliance and Prevention Measures

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>R Programming</b> 
- <b>Microsoft Power BI</b>
- <b>Ad-hoc surveys</b>

<h2>Description of the project</h2>
This project aims to disentangle the impact of Covid-19 pandemic precaution trust and prevention measures on tourist satisfaction, with a specific focus on the unique challenges faced by small businesses. To achieve this, we conducted interviews (Ad-hoc surveys; n=225) with tourists in a north Mediterranean coastal destination of Spain during the challenging summer of 2020, marked by the pandemic's worst effects. To execute this research, a two-tiered methodology was employed, combining Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) with partial least squares-path modeling (PLS-PM).

<h3>Method 1: Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA)</h3>
The EFA technique is used to group the attributes effectively, not only to reduce the number of variables under consideration but also to propose relevant destination attribute items that can be categorized into commonly applicable groups. These groupings aim to better capture the relationship with “COVID-19 pandemic precaution trust”, “Covid-19 prevention measures” and "Overall Satisfaction."

<h3>Method 2: PLS-PM model</h3>
The latent constructs derived from the EFA are subsequently employed to construct a Partial Least Squares Path Model (PLS-PM) to investigate their influence on tourists' "COVID-19 precautions trust " and "Overall Satisfaction". PLS-PM is a widely recognized and highly regarded multivariate technique that distinguishes itself from other modelling approaches by assessing direct and indirect effects within assumed causal relationships.

<h3>Results</h3>

- Traditional destination attributes of tourist satisfaction, such as "Friendliness", "Coastal area", "Product Quality",and "Security", continued to hold significance, even in the presence of the COVID-19 threat.
- Contrastingly, COVID-19 precautions trust displayed no significant impact on the levels of tourist satisfaction.
-	Equally, the "Covid-19 prevention Measures" undertaken to curtail the spread of the disease at tourist destinations failed to affect the overall tourist satisfaction directly.
-	The facet of "Security," encompassing components such as beach cleanliness and pedestrian facilities, emerged as a pivotal factor in shaping tourist satisfaction.
-	Tourist actions deemed intrusive, like navigating through crowds or sharing confined indoor spaces, were found to impact tourist satisfaction adversely.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) faced considerable challenges in reassuring customers regarding their adherence to health and safety protocols while preserving a positive tourist experience. The knowledge gained from navigating the complexities of the pandemic can offer valuable insights to assist SMEs in crafting resilience strategies for future challenges, especially in the context of climate change. These findings underscore the intricate interplay of factors that influence tourist satisfaction during disruptive events. They highlight the paramount importance of trust-building, vulnerability mitigation, and adaptability to novel circumstances in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the tourism industry.
