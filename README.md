# Analysis-of-tourist-satisfaction-during-COVID-19-
<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to disentangle the impact of pandemic precaution trust and prevention measures on tourist satisfaction, with a specific focus on the unique challenges faced by small businesses. To achieve this, we conducted interviews (Ad-hoc surveys) with tourists in a north Mediterranean coastal destination of Spain during the challenging summer of 2020, marked by the pandemic's worst effects. To execute this research, a two-tiered methodology was employed, combining Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) with partial least squares-path modeling (PLS-PM).

<h3>Method 1: Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA)</h3>
The EFA technique is used to group the attributes effectively, not only to reduce the number of variables under consideration but also to propose relevant destination attribute items that can be categorized into commonly applicable groups. These groupings aim to better capture the relationship with “COVID-19 pandemic precaution trust”, “Covid-19 prevention measures” and "Overall Satisfaction."

<h3>Method 2: PLS-PM model</h3>
The latent constructs derived from the EFA are subsequently employed to construct a Partial Least Squares Path Model (PLS-PM) to investigate their influence on tourists' "COVID-19 precautions trust " and "Overall Satisfaction". PLS-PM is a widely recognized and highly regarded multivariate technique that distinguishes itself from other modelling approaches by assessing direct and indirect effects within assumed causal relationships.
